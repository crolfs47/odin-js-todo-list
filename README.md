# odin-js-todo-list
## The Odin Project - To Do List

Project completed as part of The Odin Project. Create a To Do List using JavaScript. Users can create tasks and group them into projects. Projects and tasks can be edited and deleted.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Javascript/HTML/CSS
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - ESLint
 - Webpack
 - ES6 Modules
 - NPM
 - Web Storage API

## What I learned:
 - Better understanding of organizing code using ES6 modules - used separate modules for creating todo/project objects and creating HTML/DOM manipulation
 - Used Javascript for DOM manipulation where applicable, how to make pop up modals
 - Used Webpack for bundling modules, load CSS/images/fonts, how to use watch mode
 - How to use localStorage from the Web Storage API to save data on the user's computer

## Still can improve:
 - Could add a way to sort the todos in each project
 - Add a way to see all todos in one place, or all by date
